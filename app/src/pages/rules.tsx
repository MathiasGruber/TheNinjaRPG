          TheNinja-RPG generally adheres to PEGI 12+ guidelines to regulate language and
          content (please note that no official age classification has been given). A

          <a href="https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean">here</a> ; this guide may
          be helpful in understanding, but is not dispositive of, site policies on
          language and content. Language and content permitted under PEGI 12+ guidelines
          are subject to all applicable restrictions set forth by TheNinja-RPG&rsquo;s
          Rules and Terms of Service.

          Prohibited language and content include, but are not limited to: strong
          language, sexual references or content, inappropriate drug use references, and
          spamming.{" "}

        <p className="my-2">
          These Rules apply to the anywhere on the site where the user can submit free
          text, e.g. taverns, news comments, private messages, private chats, forum,

        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Profanity: </b>Strong language prohibited on the site includes, but is not
          limited to: sexual expletives, unnecessary and excessive profanity, and
          offensive language. Censorship (e.g., replacing vowels with symbols) does not
          make prohibited language permissible. If you are not sure if specific words
          are appropriate to use, ask a moderator.{" "}

          <b>Offensiveness: </b>Offensive language prohibited on the site includes, but
          is not limited to: racial slurs, discriminatory or hateful content, and
          malicious or intentionally harmful insults towards other users. Moderators may
          determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a specific interaction between
          users was both intended and perceived to be offensive.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Spamming: </b>Spam may include, but is not limited to: excessive use of
          capital letters; excessive use of BBCode (e.g., bold, italic, or underlined
          text, quoted text, or hyperlinks); excessive use of punctuation or symbols;
          persistently making blank, annoying or nonsensical posts; and “stretching” or
          “breaking” the tavern. As a matter of courtesy, we expect users to refrain
          from posting or messaging purely for advertising purposes. Doing so may
          constitute spamming.

          explicit sexual content, graphic or gratuitous sexual conduct, sexual nudity,
          inappropriate references to substance abuse, and inappropriate references to
          illegal drug use. Moderators may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether

          <b>CONDUCT</b>
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          Users are expected to treat others with basic courtesy and respect. Harassing,
          trolling, or otherwise pestering another user will not be tolerated. This
          includes using creative or unconventional methods – including, but not limited
          to, abusing normal game features – to harass or troll others.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Harassment:</b> Harassment may include, but is not limited to: serious or
          persistent attempts to torment others; incessantly insulting, hurtful or
          aggravating conduct; targeting others through repeated annoyances, threats, or
          personal criticisms; and unwelcome sexual advances or interactions.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Trolling: </b>Trolling may include, but is not limited to: intentional
          attempts to incite negative responses from others; intentionally baiting,
          insulting, or provocative interactions; and intentionally inflammatory or
          disruptive behavior.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Staff Positions: </b>Users are strongly discouraged from pestering game
          staff about staff positions. Excessive pestering can constitute harassment or
          spamming.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Reports: </b> Users may be penalized for persistent and intentional abuse
          of the report system. Reports are not frivolous toys or tools of personal
          revenge. It is the reporting user’s responsibility to show both rule-breaking
          and supporting evidence when filing reports. All reports should contain some
          form of relevant evidence. Blank reports that include no information
          whatsoever are essentially unsubstantiated claims, and cannot justify
          moderating actions. If you are not sure how to report a particular situation,
          message a moderator for instructions.

          <b>ACCOUNTS</b>
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          Users are responsible at all times for anything that occurs on their
          account(s). Accidents (e.g., siblings, pets, mysterious hackers and
          unverifiable glitches) will not excuse users from the Rules or entitle them to
          compensation.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Account deletions: </b>Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are
          automatically flagged for deletion and deleted in the next sweep. Users who
          anticipate extended periods of inactivity but wish to protect their accounts
          are advised to contact our support staff before they leave. Accounts are
          protected from automatic deletion regardless of activity if they have bought
          20 or more reputation points, have active federal support, or are banned from
          the game.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Account Changes: </b>The administration will not manipulate user data
          except under special and extraordinarily compelling circumstances. Users that
          request unethical or prohibited alterations may be subject to nominal
          penalties. Such alterations may include, but are not limited to: usernames,
          statistics, jutsu, ryo, reputation points, achievements, bloodlines, and ranks
          (up or down).
        </p>{" "}

          <b>FAIR GAMING</b>
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          All users are expected to play the game fairly and in the spirit of good
          sportsmanship. Cheating and other unfair gaming practices may include, but are
          not limited to: hacking, scamming, account sharing, account farming, statistic
          or kill farming, and Kage-holding.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          Players participate in unfair shortcuts and practices at their own risk.
          Relevant rules and policies will be interpreted by their intended purpose, not
          by textual limitations. Loopholes and technicalities (e.g., getting real-life
          siblings to claim to “own” illegal ryo farms) will not excuse users who act
          contrary to the spirit of these Rules.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Hacking: </b>Searching for and discovering exploits in the game is highly
          encouraged, and any reported findings richly rewarded by in-game rewards.
          Threatening or attempting to use, distributing the means for, inquiring about,
          or withholding information relevant to any founds exploits is however strictly
          prohibited. In addition to incurring penalties within the game, perpetrators
          may also be subject to legal action, e.g., for programs deemed illegal by the
          NITEC.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Scamming: </b>Informal transactions and agreements with other users are not
          condoned, encouraged, or insured by the Rules or staff. Users participate in
          such unofficial deals at their own risk; any and all resulting damages are the
          user’s sole responsibility and will not be recovered or compensated for by the
          administration. You may ask moderators to facilitate these transactions, but
          moderators are not encouraged or obligated to accommodate such requests in the
          course of their staff duties. If a moderator decides to help facilitate
          player-to-player agreements, they do so only in their capacity as a
          trustworthy third party, not in their position as staff. However, users that
          are caught scamming or otherwise cheating others may still be subject to
          penalties pursuant to fair gaming rules. Moderators may also place a visible
          warning sign on such users’ public profiles as a measure against future scams.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Kage-Holding:</b> As a general rule, moderators will not intervene in Kage
          matters as long as the Kage is reasonably active, fulfilling appropriate Kage
          functions in a timely manner, and engaging in ordinary gaming/training such
          that normal challenges from users in general are possible. No Kage is
          obligated under the Rules to be popular or likeable, act in their village’s
          best interest (as villagers see it), or accept specific challenges from
          individual players. If a Kage must be removed for appropriate reasons but is
          not in violation of any other rules (e.g., trolling), a perfunctory ban may be
          issued to remove the player from the position, but no other penalties will be
          imposed.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2 text-2xl">
          <b>MODERATION</b>
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          Case-by-case applications of the Rules are within the jurisdiction of
          moderators. Scenarios and consequences include, but are not limited to, those
          described within the text of the Rules. Nothing in the text of the Rules
          should be construed as a technical limitation to moderators’ ability to
          accomplish the intended objectives of the Rules.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          As a general policy, ambiguities in the Rules or evidence are presumed in
          favor of the user. By default, moderators have the burden of proof and must
          appropriately document and justify all moderating actions.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>User Responsibility: </b>TheNinja-RPG may change these Rules at any time.
          Any significant changes will be publicly announced to all users, but will not
          limit or negate the responsibility of all users to be aware of, understand,
          and comply with the Rules at all times. Moderators can only regulate what they
          see, either in publicly accessible areas or in reports. Users are strongly
          encouraged to use the report system. Reports are reliable evidence, and allow
          moderators to respond to problems that may occur when no moderators are
          online. If you are provoked by another user’s inappropriate behavior, report
          the offensive behavior to a moderator. No other user’s behavior (i.e., “they
          started it”) will ever be an excuse for breaking rules in retaliation.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>User Records:</b> Infractions are issued against users, not accounts. A
          user&rsquo;s record consists of infractions from all their accounts, including
          from deleted accounts. User can at any time see and review all record entries
          relating to their account. As a courtesy, moderators will avoid sharing
          information about a user&rsquo;s record and infractions, past or ongoing, with
          anyone other than that user. This includes family, friends, and even those
          attempting to speak with moderators on your behalf. If you need to talk to a
          moderator about your record or infractions, send them a PM, forum PM, or
          support ticket.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Warnings: </b>Warnings, official or unofficial, may be issued by moderators
          as a courtesy. In general, moderators are advised to allow each user no more
          than two official warnings.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Bans: </b>Using a different account to bypass an active ban is strictly
          prohibited, and may result in an extension of the original ban. Generally, the
          duration of bans will depend on the severity of the offence, the user’s prior
          record, and other circumstantial factors which moderators may deem appropriate
          to consider. Repeat offenders may also be subject to appropriate penalties
          against profits from illicit activities (e.g., ryo drains for scamming,
          statistics cuts for account sharing). Repeat offenders who continue to break
          rules may have their tavern privileges permanently removed, and/or be
          permanently banned from the game.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Staff and the Rules:</b>All staff, like users, are also required to follow
          all site rules. Ordinary misconduct from content staff and event designers can
          be reported to any moderator. Other staff misconduct can be reported to a head
          moderator or to the staff administrator. All staff also have the same
          protections under the Rules that users have. They are not required to tolerate
          any special abuses by virtue of their position. Staff impersonation is
          strictly forbidden, and includes, but is not limited to: falsely claiming to
          be staff, implicitly pretending to be staff, and falsely asserting staff
          privileges or authority.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Appeals: </b>If you believe you were issued an infraction in error,
          intentionally or otherwise, you can challenge it by complaining to the issuing
          moderator or a head moderator. If you want to appeal a properly-issued ban,
          you can appeal to the issuing moderator, a head moderator or to the staff
          administrator if there are no head moderators available/the head moderator(s)
          were the ones to issue the infraction. Permanent tavern or game ban appeals
          are usually evaluated by head moderators and the staff administrator.
          Generally, moderators can overturn their own decisions, but should not
          overturn other moderators&rsquo; decisions unless absolutely necessary. Head
          moderators can overturn the decisions of any moderator, but should not
          overturn other head moderators&rsquo; decisions unless absolutely necessary.
          The staff administrator can overturn the decisions of any other staff members
          if necessary. You can use private messages to discuss staff-related issues. If
          you cannot resolve your issue with a moderator or head moderator, contact the
          staff administrator.
