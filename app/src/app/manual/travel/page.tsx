        The world of Seichi is a vast and dangerous place. To navigate it, there are two
        levels of travel in this game; global travel and sector travel. Global travel
        shows you the entire planet segregated into so-called &quot;sectors&quot;. When
        viewing one of these sectors, you will see a {SECTOR_HEIGHT} times{" "}
        {SECTOR_WIDTH} hexagonal grid. You should think of this grid as a small section
        of that sector, in which your character can move, explore and interact with
        other players.
