        Combat is based on a turn-based system, where each user gets to perform their
        action in turns of {COMBAT_SECONDS} seconds. The user with the highest
        initiative goes first. Each action has a action point cost, and so one or more
        actions may be possible in each turn.
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5">Initiative</h2>
        Initiative is calculated by rolling a random number between 1 and 20 for each
        user. Several modifiers are added to this number:
        <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
          <li>For each lvl above defender, a bonus of 3% is added</li>
          <li>If in own territory, a bonus of 10% is added</li>
          <li>If outside own territory, initiative is reduced by 10%</li>
          <li>For consecutive PVP kills, stacking bonus of 5-0.25% are added</li>
        </ul>
      </ContentBox>
