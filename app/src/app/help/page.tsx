        <p>
          Coding is a skill that has become increasingly important in today&rsquo;s
          digital age. It involves using computer programming languages to create
          software, websites, apps, and other digital tools that help automate and
          simplify various tasks. With coding, you can bring to life anything you can
          imagine and make a real impact on the world.

            &quot;Personally, the countless hours I spent coding TNR as a youth have
            been extremely beneficial both personally and in my professional life. With
            this latest version of TNR, I hope that by enabling others to contribute to
            the codebase, we can inspire more people, young and old, to learn to code,
            while also creating an inclusive, supportive and awesome developmer
            community&quot;. ~Terr

        <h2 className="mt-3 text-2xl">How to Contribute?</h2>
        <p>
          The latest version of TNR is based on the {link_t3} and the source code is
          made available on {link_github}. You&rsquo;re highly encouraged to check out
          the codebase, as well as the {link_issues} to see if there&rsquo;s anything
          you can help with. As we progress the game, we expect to add more information
          how to contribute, so that if you are more inexperienced, we can help you get
          started. For now, you are encouraged to read up on the T3 stack and the
          technologies it&rsquo;s composed of yourself, and from there open a pull
          request on GitHub.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-3 text-2xl">Feature Requests</h2>
        <p>
          Even if you have not coding skills or desire to learn, {link_issues} is where
          you can request new game features, or help giving feedback during development
          of new features.
