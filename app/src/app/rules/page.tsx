          moderators are not encouraged or obligated to accommodate such requests in the
          course of their staff duties. If a moderator decides to help facilitate
          player-to-player agreements, they do so only in their capacity as a
          trustworthy third party, not in their position as staff. However, users that
          are caught scamming or otherwise cheating others may still be subject to

          that normal challenges from users in general are possible. No Kage is
          obligated under the Rules to be popular or likeable, act in their village’s
          best interest (as villagers see it), or accept specific challenges from

          not in violation of any other rules (e.g., trolling), a perfunctory ban may be

          Punishments for disregarding or breaking the rules may result in warnings,
          silences (for chat behaviour) or bans (for gameplay or more serious chat

        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          For communication based conflicts, punishments will be given out based on how
          the receiving party perceives it as different people will perceive different
          styles of communication as uncomfortable. Therefore specific words and phrases
          are not prohibited and instead the greater context will be looked at.

          people in public spaces who may be made uncomfortable, even if they

          the offending user if the offensive communications continue.

        <p className="my-2">
          As a general policy, ambiguities in the Rules or evidence are presumed in

          <b>User Responsibility: </b>TheNinja-RPG may change these Rules at any time.
          Any significant changes will be publicly announced to all users, but will not
          limit or negate the responsibility of all users to be aware of, understand,
          and comply with the Rules at all times. Moderators can only regulate what they
          see, either in publicly accessible areas or in reports. Users are strongly
          encouraged to use the report system. Reports are reliable evidence, and allow
          moderators to respond to problems that may occur when no moderators are
          online. If you are provoked by another user’s inappropriate behavior, report
          the offensive behavior to a moderator. No other user’s behavior (i.e., “they
          started it”) will ever be an excuse for breaking rules in retaliation.

          <b>User Records:</b> Infractions are issued against users, not accounts. A
          user&rsquo;s record consists of infractions from all their accounts, including
          from deleted accounts. User can at any time see and review all record entries
          relating to their account. As a courtesy, moderators will avoid sharing
          information about a user&rsquo;s record and infractions, past or ongoing, with
          anyone other than that user. This includes family, friends, and even those
          attempting to speak with moderators on your behalf. If you need to talk to a
          moderator about your record or infractions, send them a PM, forum PM, or
          support ticket.

          <b>Bans: </b>Using a different account to bypass an active ban is strictly
          prohibited, and may result in an extension of the original ban. Generally, the
          duration of bans will depend on the severity of the offence, the user’s prior
          record, and other circumstantial factors which moderators may deem appropriate
          to consider. Repeat offenders may also be subject to appropriate penalties
          against profits from illicit activities (e.g., ryo drains for scamming,
          statistics cuts for account sharing). Repeat offenders who continue to break
          rules may have their tavern privileges permanently removed, and/or be
          permanently banned from the game.{" "}

          <b>Staff and the Rules:</b>All staff, like users, are also required to follow

          be reported to any moderator. Other staff misconduct can be reported to a head
          moderator or to the staff administrator. All staff also have the same
          protections under the Rules that users have. They are not required to tolerate
          any special abuses by virtue of their position. Staff impersonation is
          strictly forbidden, and includes, but is not limited to: falsely claiming to
          be staff, implicitly pretending to be staff, and falsely asserting staff
          privileges or authority.{" "}

        <p className="my-2">
          <b>Appeals: </b>If you believe you were issued an infraction in error,
          intentionally or otherwise, you can challenge it by complaining to the issuing
          moderator or a head moderator. If you want to appeal a properly-issued ban,
          you can appeal to the issuing moderator, a head moderator or to the staff
          administrator if there are no head moderators available/the head moderator(s)
          were the ones to issue the infraction. Permanent tavern or game ban appeals
          are usually evaluated by head moderators and the staff administrator.
          Generally, moderators can overturn their own decisions, but should not
          overturn other moderators&rsquo; decisions unless absolutely necessary. Head
          moderators can overturn the decisions of any moderator, but should not
          overturn other head moderators&rsquo; decisions unless absolutely necessary.
          The staff administrator can overturn the decisions of any other staff members
          if necessary. You can use private messages to discuss staff-related issues. If
          you cannot resolve your issue with a moderator or head moderator, contact the
