        <h3 className="text-md font-bold pt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1 Overview</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes do not reset and remain permanently attached to a user’s
          record. Moderators typically issue one official warning before applying a
          strike, unless the violation is severe. A moderator may issue an unofficial
          warning or rule reminder before issuing a strike or official warning. However,
          it is considered a courtesy and is not required before official action is
          taken.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-bold pt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 Strike Levels</h3>
        <ul className="pl-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            <b>Strike 1:</b> 24-hour Silence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Strike 2:</b> 72-hour Silence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Strike 3:</b> 1-week Silence
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Strike 4:</b> 1-month Silence. Appeals are allowed but rarely granted
            without substantial proof of error.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Escalation:</b> Violations beyond 4 strikes may lead to a permanent
            Silence or Ban.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-md font-bold pt-3">

        </h3>
        <ul className="pl-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            <b>Minimum Duration:</b> Silences under 24 hours are not considered strikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bans:</b> Bans count as 2 strikes. A 3rd ban could lead to a permanent
            ban.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Immediate Action:</b> Severe violations (e.g., hate speech, threats,
            doxxing, sexual harassment) may result in immediate silences or bans,
            possibly permanent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abuse of bugs and game play mechanics will result in a ban instead of a
            silence. Game abuse will not be tolerated. Users may not be given a warning
            if the abuse is believed to be intentional.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strikes for punishments that have been completed may be removed, under
            review, after a year of good behaviour. However removal is not guaranteed.

            Screenshots and grabs may be submitted as evidence however the use of them
            is at the discretion of the moderation staff and may be dismissed due to the

          TNR is provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis. Players use the platform at
          their own risk

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">13. Discord</h2>
        <p className="my-2">
          Discord is used as an official means of communication for TNR and the TNR
          community. Bug and moderation tickets can be submitted there as an official
          channel. However for moderation issues the in-game report feature is
          encouraged to create reliable in-game evidence in addition to a moderation
          ticket if one is submitted. Updates and game changes may be posted in Discord
          in addition to in-game.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-bold pt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;13.1 Rules</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;The TNR discord generally follows rules and TNR of the website,
          but may have additional rules in place in a separate rule channel. It also
          follows the official Discord ToS. It is important to familiarize yourself with
          both sets of the rules. Strikes on discord are considered separate from
          strikes in-game, except for rare or extreme circumstances. Therefore a person
          may be banned or removed from the discord but be allowed to remain in-game.
          Individuals considered exceptionally disruptive to the TNR discord community
          may be removed, as discord is considered non essential for gameplay.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-bold pt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2 External Discords</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Any discord besides the main TNR server is considered unofficial,
          regardless of whether it is run by a staff member or player, and is not
          required to follow the official TNR rules. These servers are joined at the
          risk of the player and are not the responsibility of TNR. Except when evidence
          of in-game infractions (such as botting, account sharing, exploitation etc.)
          or extreme circumstances (stalking, doxxing etc.) official action will not be
          taken against a player for behaviour within those servers. If users are
          experiencing negativity or disruptions within these servers, they are
          encouraged to leave them.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-md font-bold pt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2.1 Staff</h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Staff may create, moderate, or participate in external discords.
          While action in these discords are not considered official staff actions,
          staff are still expected to remain reasonably professional as a reflection of
          the community they work for.
