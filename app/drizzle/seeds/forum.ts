While the country remains warm for most of the year, the north experiences constant snow and the south enjoys an equal amount of rain during winter.

The endless green plains are especially beautiful to watch during summer. Towards the west, the plains turn into hills with denser forests. The land is much cooler on the east where the country welcomes cool winds from its neighbor, the Snow country. The scent of smoke hangs in almost every region of the nation.",

Home to the highest peak, Mount Tenken, the nation is generally at a higher elevation than the others. The otherwise barren valleys are filled with beautiful wildflowers during summer.

With bamboo jungles, waterfalls, and bays, this tropical rainforest is home to many natural hot springs and active volcanoes. The land is shrouded by a dense fog that is formed due to thick plumes of steam from the volcanic mountains spilling into the surrounding ocean under cooler temperatures. The islands receive regular rain and experience a long wet season.",

The countryâ€™s primary water resources are oases. White-sanded beaches with crystal clear water rim the eastern coast, where the land is fertile enough for cultivation. One large river runs towards the eastern coast from the center, cutting through the rocks to form a canyon of rushing rapids.",
