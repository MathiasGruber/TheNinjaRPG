Repository: TheNinja-RPG
Description: A next.js web application for an online ninja game

Directory Structure:

- app/src/: Main application code
- app/src/app/: Next.js app router
- app/src/app/api/: REST API endpoints
- app/src/server/: tRPC endpoints
- app/drizzle/: Database schemas
- app/tests/: Test files

Setup:

- Run `yes | sudo npm install -g bun && cp app/.env.example app/.env &&cd app && bun install` to install dependencies
- Run `CI=true bun test` for testing
- Run `bun lint` for linting

Guidelines:

- ONLY create tests to verify your implementation if your changes involve critical or complicated business logic; for simple and small changes, you can skip writing tests
- When listing a directory, do not need to search all directories, use `find [PATH] -type f -not -path "*/\(node_modules\|.next\|.git\|assets\|scripts\)/*" -exec grep -l "[SEARCH_STRING]" {} \;`
- Always make sure to test that the project lints successfully and that all tests pass before committing your changes.
- Before you consider your solution final, please ensure that you also look at other possibly similar things in the codebase, so as to ensure a consistent approach to solving problems across the codebase; i.e. similar ways of structuring tRPC endpoints, similar way of using UI components, etc.
