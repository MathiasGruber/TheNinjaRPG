Please ensure that the project lints successfully and that all tests pass. Before linting or testing the project, be sure to set things up to use bun & use the correct environment variables as follows:

```bash
yes | sudo npm install -g bun
cp app/.env.example app/.env
cd app && bun install
```

Always create tests to verify your implementation. Tests can be executed with the following statement:

```bash
 CI=true bun test
```

Linting can be executed with the following statement:

```bash
bun lint
```

Before you consider your solution final, please ensure that you also look at other possibly similar things in the codebase, so as to ensure a consistent approach to solving problems across the codebase; i.e. similar ways of structuring tRPC endpoints, similar way of using UI components, etc.
