# How to contribute

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository on GitHub.
- On your local machine,
  [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork of
  the repository.

## Making Changes

- Add code to your local fork. It's usually a [good
  idea](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/do-not-issue-pull-requests-from-your-master-branch/)
  to make changes on a
  [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
  with the branch name relating to the feature you are going to add.
- When you are ready for others to examine and comment on your new feature,
  navigate to your fork of `TheNinjaRPG` on GitHub and open a [pull
  request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (PR). Note that
  after you launch a PR from one of your fork's branches, all
  subsequent commits to that branch will be added to the open pull request
  automatically.
- When the PR is approved it will be merged into main and automatically deployed onto [www.theninja-rpg.com](www.theninja-rpg.com)

## Code Conventions

- Code should be as readable as possible; hard to understand logic requires comments. Too many comments is not good though, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA).

- We use [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) for commits, to make things a bit more ðŸ”¥

- It is expected that code complies with the ESlint and prettier settings in this repo.
